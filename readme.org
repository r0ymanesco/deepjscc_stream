* Causal DeepJSCC coding for video streaming
The objective of this repo is to create a causal JSCC scheme for video streaming.
The following ideas will be implemented:
** [ ] Use a transformer model to perform autoregressive coding
** [ ] Consider longer skip connections
** [ ] Use an entropy model to estimate the information content of the codeword and determine where key frames should be initialized
** [ ] Use a quantisation method to learn a discrete latent space. This will allow us to use the IEEE 802.15.4 standard.
** [ ] Alternatively, consider integrating the full OFDM pipeline, including:
*** Pilots + equaliser
*** 3GPP channel models
*** PAPR constraint

* Notes
** The positional embedding is not good for stability
